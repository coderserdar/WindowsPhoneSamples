        In this scenario, the app will renew its notification channel.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Notification channels expire after 30 days. Every time your app is launched, it should renew your channel and 
        send it to your server to ensure your service always has an updated channel. Requesting a new channel does not 
        revoke previously acquired channels. If your app provides its primary content through its tile and the user is 
        not expected to launch the app frequently, it is recommended that your app consider using a background task to 
        periodically request a new channel in addition to requesting a new channel every time your app is launched.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note that your app's package will need to set the "Internet (client)" capability in its manifest.
