            The local decoder sample shows how you can install a video decoder for use by the 
            application when playing video encoded in a format supported by the decoder. This 
            feature can be used to provide support for video formats not natively supported 
            by Windows. As with all Media Extensions, the media component is only available to 
            this application and only when the application is running.
