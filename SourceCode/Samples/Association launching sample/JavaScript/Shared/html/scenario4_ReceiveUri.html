            In Internet Explorer, type 'alsdkjs://helloworld' into the address bar and press enter. After the dialog this sample will be launched. This sample sets the DesiredView element within the Protocol extension category to "useLess". When you launch the sample from another app, such as IE, this preference tells the system to attempt to use a smaller portion of the screen for the sample and leave the rest for other apps.

            Use a different language version of this sample (e.g., the C# version), in
            scenario 2, type 'alsdkjs://helloworld' into the textbox and tap the
            "Launch Default Handler" button above. It will launch this sample app into
            this page.
