                <p>In this scenario, the app will be set up to receive raw notifications from the cloud while it is running and 
				   visible.</p>
				<p>Your app can use raw notifications to communicate between your app and your app service while your app is 
				   running, even if it is not a lock screen app. This allows your app service to send messages to your running 
				   app without maintaining a persistent connection between the app and the service.</p>
				<p>When the user starts your app, it should connect directly to its app service to let the service know that 
				   the app is running and ready to receive the raw notifications. The app service then sends raw notifications 
				   to the app. When your app loses visibility, it should tell your app's cloud service that it is no longer 
				   available to receive raw notifications. Note that raw notifications can be received by any running app as 
				   long as it has an active push notification channel.</p>
				<h4>Open a channel in Scenario 1, and send a raw notification from your server to the app. The content of
					the notification will be displayed here.
