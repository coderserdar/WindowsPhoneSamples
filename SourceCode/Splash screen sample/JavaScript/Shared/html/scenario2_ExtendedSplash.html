            Retrieve the coordinates of the splash screen image. You can use this location to
            show an extended splash screen while your app performs additional loading tasks.
            This may make it seem like your app takes more time to load, but it provides a better
            user experience if your app has to complete time-intensive tasks before being ready
            for user interactions.
