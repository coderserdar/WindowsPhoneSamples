                <p>In this scenario, the app will be set up to receive raw notifications from the cloud by creating a background 
				   task.</p>
				<p>Raw notifications are a notification type sent through the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS) which can 
				   trigger background task code to run when the notification is received by Windows. Raw notifications can only 
				   cause your app's background task to activate if your app has been added to the lock screen. See the "Lock 
				   Screen Apps" sample for examples of how to request lock screen app permissions.</p>
				<p>Once your app is on the lock screen, the push notification can activate a background task that executes your 
				   app's logic. The background task can include an inspection of the contents of the push notification to 
				   perform context-specific actions. Note that your app needs an active push notification channel to receive 
				   notifications. You should renew your channel every time the user launches your app -- see the "Push and 
				   Periodic Notifications" sample for more information about acquiring and renewing a notification channel.</p>
				<p>Note that your app's package will need to set the "Internet (client)" capability in its manifest.</p>
