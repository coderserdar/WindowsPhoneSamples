When I was creating mobile apps with **C#** in *Windows Phone 8*, I started to search some sample projects to make my apps better. After much years, I found the sample Windows Phone projects and I want to share that info with you.

I know that *Windows Phone OS* is no longer alive. But you can use these projects for learning and using **XAML** technology, and you can improve your *C#* knowledge with these projects.

|  Programming Language  |  WP SDK Version  | Development Platform |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
|          *C#*          |      *8*       |  *Microsoft Visual Studio 2013*   |

In this repo, there are about 70-80 projects which are about various subjects in *Windows Phone* development
These are;
- *Background Services*
- *Bluetooth Usage*
- *Calendar Usage*
- *Sensor Usage (Compass, Gyrometer etc.)*
- *Notifications*
- *Scheduled Jobs*
- *Splash Screen*
- *App Bar*
- *User and Custom Controls*
- *Globalization*
- *Media Operations*
- *File Operations*
- *Authentication and Authorization*
- *Tiles and Badges*
- *JSON and JavaScript*
- *Threads* etc.. 

You should use [*Windows Phone 8 SDK*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35471) and [*Microsoft Visual Studio 2013*](https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/5/5/255DCCB6-F364-4ED8-9758-EF0734CA86B8/vs2013.3_dskexp_ENU.iso)
I was writing my code in *Microsoft Visual Studio 2015* but I suppose that these links will work for you.

Keep with coding...
With my best regards.
