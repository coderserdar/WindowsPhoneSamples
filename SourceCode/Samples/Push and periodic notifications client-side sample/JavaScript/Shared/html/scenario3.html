        Notifications can come from the cloud at any time. While your application is not visible on the 
        user's screen, notifications could provide valuable information. If the user is looking at your 
        application, it might be appropriate to suppress these notifications. You can listen for the 
        arrival of push notifications through the PushNotificationReceived event.</p>
        <h4>Press the buttons below to begin listening for notification events. The app will stop listening when
            you leave this scenario or press "Stop listening for notifications"</h4>
        <button id="scenario2StartListening">Start listening for push notifications</button>
