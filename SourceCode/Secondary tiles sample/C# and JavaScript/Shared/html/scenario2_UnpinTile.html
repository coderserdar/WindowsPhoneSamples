        <p>In this scenario, we will unpin the tile that was pinned to Start in scenario 1. If this
                            were an actual application, we would first want to check whether the tile that we're
                            unpinning exists. Please refer to scenario 4 for an example of how to check
                            whether a tile is pinned to Start.</p>
