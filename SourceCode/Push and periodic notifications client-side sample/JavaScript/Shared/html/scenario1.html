        In this scenario, the app will request a notification channel and send it to the app's cloud service. 
        Additionally, this scenario shows how to close a notification channel.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A notification channel uniquely identifies an instance of your app per user, per machine. The notification 
        channel can be used to send tile, toast, badge, and raw notifications to a specific user on a specific device. Each 
        app can have only one channel per tile. The channel created for the app's primary tile can be used to send all 
        notification types. Each tile on the Start screen will have a unique channel to which tile notifications can be sent. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once your app receives a push notification channel, the app should send it to your app's cloud service, which 
        will store the channel and associate it with the app user who sent the channel. When you want to send a 
        notification to a user (for example, to update the user's app tile) the app cloud service will perform an HTTP 
        POST operation on the channel URI. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Because notification channels expire, your app must take care to manage the renewal of the notification channels, 
        which is discussed in scenario 2.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note that your app's package will need to set the "Internet (client)" capability in its manifest. This allows it 
        to communicate with the Internet to send channels to your app's server.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There may be cases where it is appropriate to close a push notification channel. For example, if a user account 
        is tied to the notifications they receive and the user logs off that account, the channel should be closed if the 
        user clears her credentials.

        <h4>Click the buttons below to open or close notification channels. Note that you must specify a URL 
            and authentication parameters in the source code for this sample. </h4>
        <p><label for="serverURL">URL of the server that will store your notification channel URI (required):</label>
            <input type="text" id="serverUrlField" size="100" maxlength="256" value="http://" /></p>
        <button id="registerChannel">Reopen channel and send to server</button>
        <button id="closeChannel">Close channel</button>
