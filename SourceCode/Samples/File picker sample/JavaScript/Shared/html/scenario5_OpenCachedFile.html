            Demonstrates how an app that integrates with the Cached File Updater contract can
            provide the latest version of a file to your app. This scenario requires that you
            have the File Picker Contracts Sample app.
            <br />
            <br />
            Steps:<br />
            1) Launch the file picker with the "Pick cached file" button<br />
            2) Select "File picker contracts sample" app from the list of locations<br />
            3) Select scenario "3) Pick cached file"<br />
            4) Click "Add file to basket" and click "Open" in the file picker<br />
            5) Click "Output latest version" button<br />
